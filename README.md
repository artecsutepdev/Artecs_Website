## Post Frontmatter

| Property (\* required) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title \*               | Self explanatory. Used as the text link to the post, the h1 on the posts' page, and the pages title property. Has a max length of 60 chars, set in `src/content/config.ts`                                                                                                                                   |
| description \*         | Similar to above, used as the seo description property. Has a min length of 50 and a max length of 160 chars, set in the post schema.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| publishDate \*         | Again pretty simple. To change the date format/locale, currently **en-GB**, update the date option in `src/site.config.ts`. Note you can also pass additional options to the component `<FormattedDate>` if required.                                                                                        |
| updatedDate            | This is an optional date representing when a post has been updated, in the same format as the publishDate.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| tags                   | Tags are optional with any created post. Any new tag(s) will be shown in `yourdomain.com/posts` & `yourdomain.com/tags`, and generate the page(s) `yourdomain.com/tags/[yourTag]`                                                                                                                            |
| coverImage             | This is an optional object that will add a cover image to the top of a post. Include both a `src`: "_path-to-image_" and `alt`: "_image alt_". You can view an example in `src/content/post/cover-image.md`.                                                                                                 |
| ogImage                | This is an optional property. An OG Image will be generated automatically for every post where this property **isn't** provided. If you would like to create your own for a specific post, include this property and a link to your image, the theme will then skip automatically generating one.            |
| draft                  | This is an optional property as it is set to false by default in the schema. By adding true, the post will be filtered out of the production build in a number of places, inc. getAllPosts() calls, og-images, rss feeds, and generated page[s]. You can view an example in `src/content/post/draft-post.md` |

## Note Frontmatter

| Property (\* required) | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| title \*               | string, max length 60 chars.                       |
| description            | to be used for the head meta description property. |
| publishDate \*         | ISO 8601 format with offsets allowed.              |

## Frontmatter snippets
